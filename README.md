## üöÄ Development & Deployment (IBM Cloud)

### 1. Model Preparation

- Created model script locally using Python-based NLP components
- Packaged as `.tar.gz` or `.zip` archive with inference logic
- Verified response schema to ensure clean, readable output

### 2. Upload to IBM Cloud

- Uploaded model artifact via:
  - IBM Cloud Console (Watson Studio)
  - or IBM Cloud CLI / REST API (`ml/v4/models` endpoint)
- Bound storage instance for managing artifact access

### 3. Deployment Creation

- Created a new deployment under Watson Machine Learning
- Selected configuration: *Online Deployment* (synchronous inference)
- Configured metadata (name, description, tags for educational access)
- Selected public accessibility option for endpoint sharing

### 4. Endpoint Activation

- IBM Cloud generated an endpoint like: https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/ml/v4/deployments/56cccd3a-9e17-4f00-b426-fbf299ee1ca3/ai_service?version=2021-05-01
